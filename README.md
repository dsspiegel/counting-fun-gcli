# Counting Fun! 🍎🚗🐶

**[▶️ Play the Game Now!](https://dsspiegel.github.io/counting-fun-gcli/)**

A simple, colorful web game designed for toddlers to practice counting and number recognition.

The game flashes a random number of fun emojis (like apples, cars, or puppies), and the player simply clicks the matching number button. It's designed to be frustration-free with bouncy animations, cheerful sound effects, and positive voice encouragement.

## Features

*   **Toddler-Friendly UI:** Large, easy-to-tap buttons and high-contrast colors.
*   **Audio Feedback:** Cheerful sounds for correct answers and a gentle voice that reads the numbers aloud.
*   **Adjustable Difficulty:** Start with numbers 1-3 and scale up to 20 as they learn.
*   **Engaging Rewards:** Confetti celebrations for every correct answer! 🎉
*   **Responsive:** Works great on tablets, desktops, and mobile phones.

## How to Play

1.  **Count:** Look at the screen to see how many items appear.
2.  **Click:** Press the big button with the matching number.
3.  **Celebrate:** Enjoy the confetti and praise!

*Tip: You can change the maximum number (from 1 up to 20) using the subtle selector in the bottom-left corner.*

## Development

This is a lightweight, zero-dependency project built with vanilla **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Everything is contained in a single file (`index.html`).

### Running Locally

If you want to run the game on your own machine:

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Open `index.html` in any web browser.

Alternatively, to serve it like a real website (useful for testing on other devices on your network):

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```
Then visit `http://localhost:8000`.
